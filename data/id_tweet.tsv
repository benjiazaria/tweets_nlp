1	Movie that wasn't long enough: ZOLA Movie that was too long: WEST SIDE STORY Movie that was just the right length: SHIVA BABY.
2	if we are taking that deleted scene as canon, can you imagine how Julieta must’ve felt hearing her brother say that? Her baby brother no less? She’s known as the healer, she’s supposed to fix things but even her food can’t fix /that/.
3	hobi baby is going to wake up to three posts which he didn't get to like way before all of us :( .
4	@maobi31 @Motla_M Don’t fight me I have a heart problem🤧I’m only mentioning that coz of a friend who’s baby mama did that and fell into a trap.
5	@fettsaber LMFHAODOSO NOOOOOO i explained it to him and he was so skeptical he was like 🤨 but his name is BABY YODA.
6	@DJVro999 i’m spittin fr we really got som new lil baby pop smoke trippie juice polo 21 tory carti etc..
7	hold up she wanted to say something: I will let her type: ----------------------------------------- hello world my name is meleay auntie's silliest BABY BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH IM ACTUALLY 8 YEARS OLD WOW well i just wanted to say hi people of twitter. Keep on tweeting #mel out!.
8	Look, okay, if the partner and I stick to naming eligible kids after grandmothers it’s Dorothy, Hermione, or Ariel so blame my great-grandparents. .
9	Couldn't be happier for incredible @maddy_anholt whose book is published in 2022. I've believed in this book (& the show that came before it) since How To Leave Your Psychopath was notes over a coffee in a bar in Paddington! Love it when good things happen to wonderful people 💫 .
10	is it supposed to be "real treasure?" i really need to not shitpost while i'm still working on my coffee.
11	@GroseAndrew @WestJet WestJet, AirCanada it's hard to choose they take turns at shitty customers service. RN westjet is in top position..
12	@James_AG1 @The_JasonM @dieter That’s hard to answer. I think the trading up part is where I’d draw the line. I didn’t like the pick, personally. But knowing what we do now, would you draft Josh Allen first overall instead of Mayfield knowing he’d be pretty bad until year 3? If TL develops, it’s a great pick..
13	Pretty sure the message was not to stress yourself out with the pressure of upholding these traditions. We go through enough. Besides, if you clean year round then why you need to be hard down cleaning on New Year's eve? Rest. .
14	@johnredwood Pssst! John, most of us know the Tories, including you, are all either inveterate liars or utterly ignorant ideologues. No one, except your hard core supporters vote Tory, & they do so simply bc they're either xenophobes, v wealthy or like voting against their own best interests..
15	@BadFanficWritr Because Abuela obviously wasn't, so SOMEBODY had to. Dad understands his daughter better than anyone. He even says it once: Marrying into a magical family when you don't get a power was hard, but they make it work. He understands what Mirabel is going through..
16	@kirawontmiss I would try so hard and for what 🤨 I usually did better than most the class tho so that's a confidence boost right there.
17	to the one who played dual role as my parents since i was a child. im so sorry for not being enough for u, hurting u, n walked away whenever u called my name. tbh it's still hard for me but i always try to let u go. i miss u so much. i love u and always will. ur 4th grandchild..
18	It's a little hard to relate to the problems of someone who somehow accrued this level of "F-ck You" money and privilege by age 55, and yet feels like she doesn't have options....
19	@RyanRok @GeorgeTakei I'm not going to say either one is a great take, but which do you think it worse: vaccinated people who wish death on antivaxxers, or people who are happy that some vaccinated people get sick and/or die? Hard to say imho.
20	@pIanetbabs its kind of hard to make out, i think it may be the lace in the first card or a rose pattern > < i dont have my glasses on LOL.
21	@DeborahMeaden Watched it to the very end end etc … topical satire but found it a bit boring or just hard to stick with, I kept getting easily distracted, which if a film is really good is unusual..
22	@trbyes Yes. But it is the only way to fix it. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's asking "a lot." How many more years will all these excuses still keep coming? It's not my fault that it means they have to do something hard. Yes, they do. Or live with it..
23	@socialistsunday So why did they bring it in if they're just going to reverse it within a few hours, if this was implemented for a good reason then what has changed, if they brought it in to shake shit up then I have to ask what the fuck do they think they are playing at? It's all very strange!.
24	Now when I imagine a good time, I think me and 14,999 of my closest friends wearing diapers and standing in the same spot for hours in the worst part of the city waiting for a moment that lasts sixty seconds and looks better on tv.
25	This section 60 Order is due to incidents in the early hours of the morning, including a firearms discharge and weapons found during the sweep of the area.
26	@coworkerlauren I feel this so much. I'm worried about Miles going back to school but I also don't know what I'll do if he doesn't. I have classes three days away for three hours at a time. Nicolas has to work. It's a mess either way and I am ✨done✨.
27	I'm so fucking excited to get out of this god forsaken town even if it is just for a couple hours. Saturday will be very good and nothing is going to stop it.
28	@airfrance My year end would be better if Air France could reunite me with my luggage in Moscow… my suitcase has been on Moscow 31 hours (24 hours less than me) but no contact about delivery. No calls and phone calls not answered, appalling service!.
29	@_Rizzlaa The throwing up in the morning enn no fun at all.. I literally was throwing up for 7 hours.
30	6. Biggest struggle was during my very first Dark Souls game. I was facing O& S for the first time and I think I was stuck on them for like 10 hours over the span of 2 streams. It was a huuuge learning opportunity though, and extremely satisfying to defeat them!.
31	@EssexPR My brother, cancer patient tested positive Christmas Eve, still testing positive… said he had a cold for 24 hours, feels fine.
32	@Crumblybum I've noticed that you are keen on this. A good plan but I don't think there is the slightest chance of it happening. Whether pushed or leaving through 'ill health' or 'his job done', Johnson will be gone within months..
33	@nunyabizniz80 The Democrats are absolutely there to lose. Their job is to "fight the good fight" and lose, and the GOP's job is to convince regular people that lowering everyone's taxes is a good deal for them. It just means you have to come out of pocket for everything like health care, etc.
34	Thanks to Brian Andreas for this good thought as we enter a new year! “Most people don't know there are angels whose only job is to make sure you don't get too comfortable & fall asleep & miss your life. ”.
35	@WalterSobchakSr @philipaklein That’s the city’s job. But it’s also the city’s job to protect those communities that are most at risk — which means mandating the most basic safety guidelines for public spaces. What would you have officials do, foresake those same communities entirely?.
36	@MeepRL_ @Gabledoo @OldMemeArchive No, pop music shifted its target audience to YouTube revenue. Who can put in the most hours? People with no job, that get obsessed easily, and don't yet have artistic standards or taste. (kids) Then radio reflected this, and started playing baby music for adults, who hated it..
37	@StatuesqueFem @KimMangone Biden is just the third term of Obama. So Mr. McConnell is technically still doing the same job is doing in 2009. Good for you Mr. McConnell. Let’s go Brandon!.
38	@SorelliMoran *the nurses and John take her to the surgery room with Greg* J: it’s fine eli it will be over soon.
39	@ShaunLintern As soon as we are “ramping up” capacity to cope with a disease “surge” then we know we are in the realms of fictional politicisation of the matter ?.
40	@HerringAli I haven’t submitted to you yet but this made my blood pressure spike all the same. Hopefully you’ll get responses from a few horrified writers soon!.
41	@timabray When did they take his spine & heart? As soon as he agreed to take the job? This is something..
42	Just been having fun talking to my art friends ^__^♡♡♡ loveeeee chitchatting lol gonna clean room soon though.
43	this is literally my intrusive thought, cause as soon as i think “we outta here”, BOOM. body immediately goes to shambles. .
44	@SatanWantsU2 @cynical_4thborn *As soon as smexi drops to the ground Lucifer grabs cyntan by the tail and swings him full force above his head and throws him into his twin causing them to crash against the wall and then the ground. Before they can make any other move he grabs both of their tails and pulls > > .
45	3) Watch NWH Okay so I'm probably not gonna get to watch nwh bc I'm in quarantine for the rest of the year. But as soon as I'm back home, I'm gonna go see it with friends..
46	Have not made this in a while. One of my fav drinks soon to be ready for new years eve. Woo. .
47	@PoliticMinotaur @BryMullen @ryangrim @sam4soph Yea, people in this thread are acting like being in the halls of congress for 25-40 years and building personal relationships and professional ones with your colleagues is nothing as soon as a "progressive running for prez" in opposition to all that moderation comes along. Its.
48	@ellieliima The big question. I am not sure I see a tour happening soon unless things get better but who knows. Not sure even things like the super bowl fest will go on at this rate 😢.
49	The CDC changed its protocols because they watched MNF and said no way can we have IAN BOOK play this year.
50	REMINDER: PLEASE BOOK VACCINE APPOINTMENTS THROUGH AHS We have been receiving calls to book vaccine appointments, and would like to remind residents that all vaccine booking is done through AHS: AHS is also the resource for any vaccine related inquiries..
51	"Underwater Wild" was my favorite book that I read this year - I highly recommend it. Wonderful story and photography (in the original meaning of the word: full of wonder). .
52	@jofromgreylynn Productive? There's an old book called "Make Ducks Pay" - the bastards shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. .
53	@eklogit Circe is gonna be one of the first I read cuz I’ve had that book since 2018 and I STILL haven’t read it lmao.
54	@clumsyoaf33 I don’t know what it is about Harry Potter that makes me like it , I don’t like movies with magic in or stuff like that but the book just wanted me reading more 😂 that’s good all is well.
55	I designed this new book scented candle for fun. I just wanted to get my work published more so every day I'm going to try and post something. -T .
56	Looking forward to a fun night in. Why not stay home tonight and free up places for the kids in their 20s and 30s to get out and enjoy - such a tough time for them having been stuck home so much during Lockdown. 🙏🏻.
57	@FCBarcelona Stop addressing Araujo as a teen ffs😭 he's a man he literally has a wife and planning kids.
58	I listen to the questions the therapists at work ask my kids and they're so fucking remedial. Like how tf you get paid so much more than me to not even come into work, have 5 minute phone call sessions with the kids, meanwhile I'm here for 12+ hours and I'm hustling..
59	Hello from Saguaro High School in Arizona! Oklahoma State stuffing backpacks with school supplies and gifts for local kids. This thing is awesome. And intense. @CowboyFB #OKState .
60	I think they are playing cat and mouse with the teachers. I don’t believe for a second that kids will actually go back on Wednesday #onpoli .
61	Lastly, are you going to direct that kids with symptoms will be send home? Until now , my son said there were many visibly sick kids in his classes and nobody did nothing. So, what is the plan for parents like me and our kids?.
62	I also didn't have to have numerous convos with my kids in 2020 where they kept asking why none of the grown-ups seemed to care even the slightest bit about protecting them at school (bc they were online in 2020), but I had them a LOT in 2021, so there's also that..
63	@AyoCaesar High these are six of my favourite. @AlannaMaxBooks Zeki and Lulu books are especially good for toddlers and pre-schoolers. Mr Hoot stars a boy from a mixed race family. Siba and Saba perhaps suited to slightly older kids, but counting element likely to appeal to toddlers. .
64	@maritstiles No one asked about kids eating in classrooms and hallways. The most dangerous activity in schools..
65	UK is in a bad place. Conservatives and the opposition (Lab and/or Lib Dems) are considered by many as 2 sides of same coin. This leaves big space for ultra right and fascism. Huge increase in raw intolerance by those who feel disenfranchised by both sides! Democracy threatened!.
66	@TheLostGlitches For everyone all the best. May you all find your place within crypto and Nft land. Happy new year!.
67	@GenealogyOfAdam This is a nice sentiment. But it actually denies the reality of how these parishes and churches were established in the first place. They were established by small emigrant communities in search for a better life, so they can help the families back home and not by.
68	Seeing all this Shaw talk. I’m not gassing any of these mugs. Next week they’ll go and stink out the place and then what ?.
69	@pab1990 I know we’re getting to an odd age but stuff falls into place as it should. Everyone’s path there is different though. I feel like an idiot for getting stuck in a job I hate for 13 years..
70	Agreed. We will be in a much healthier place holistically than we were 10-15 years ago, if our teammates would read first and implement rather than criticize. Fortunately, many are and it’s apparent given their improved readiness. @USACIMT @TRADOC @JRTCandFortPolk @16thSMA .
71	I made you my happy place and now we are fading away and I’m trying to find a different outlet cs you were mine.
72	better damage better place on teams better ki wise goated tank much more needed as lead with a goated ls.

74	@androprepe @Telegraph I would not know mate.. Perhaps ask one.. anything else is subjective.. What's the mantra.. Ah yes.. ...poor knowledge plus good logic equals a worse theory than greater knowledge plus same logic! Kinda obvious don't you think. The ancient Greeks had far too much free time ).
75	@Bloodartist_SWL You reserve those words for things worth saying, Elias. Or, finding a better way to express such things. And, I would love to meet with you again. To put those broad shoulders of yours to use? Even better, I think..
76	rlly annoys me when ppl think being gay is a trend n quirky n cute. we literally cannot help who we r n no one, unless ur gay, will understand how scary and daunting coming out to ur family rlly is. its not something that u can help n it’s not a trend..
77	That’s through low wages and continued control of access to healthcare during a global pandemic. More than ever, I think people need to explore the easiest and most accessible paths to independent labor that they can find…everybody #BlackBurnout.
78	Father, I think, is a profoundly insecure person, at his core. With some, I recall him as passive, and dormat-like. With others, I recall him as abusive and controlling, not respecting boundaries..
79	what do we think college mj’s clothes are gonna be like bc i can’t imagine them still dressing her the exact same.
80	@ShaunTobikosan I don’t think optimal health can be any one thing. It’s a nothing-ism. To me, health is mix of absence of healthy issues, achieving the best version of yourself possible in the least amount of time possible. Optimal is finding the right mix of these three for yourself..
81	@ApianChasity @MelpomeneMel @fitterhappierAJ I think hoidy people are just too quick to say it was luck, when really most people can figure out how gravity works for example. And it's convenient if elites can push down those lower to get them to behave. It's about control not true knowledge or science..
82	@lucaslameiras Sim! There have been a couple more unicorns over the past couple weeks so I think that figure is already outdated haha.
83	@jaredfarmer1987 I thought Heupel was the QB guru….I think now that we’ve found our QB1 a real off-season can do wonders for a guy like him.
84	Progress, population are is not linear. I can't back it up with hard data but I think chances of India still being a poor developing country in 2040 is massively greater than it being a superpower because of rapid brain drain. It'll be less populated though..
85	So I think the overall opinions about Kirk aren’t that divisive. The actual subject of the debate is, if this is good enough to go all the way and I‘ll share my thoughts about this later in this thread..
86	@michaelbewley @robmarkcole @ChelleGentemann By using a timeseries or other supporting features as inputs, perhaps. Humans are good at seeing visual patterns in an image, computers are good at seeing patterns across multiple dimensions. But I think your point is valid! But "just train a model, duh" was reductive..
87	@7FigSaykho Adding these to my list too! For self development . I’d recommend, can’t hurt me & think like a monk. For business - 7 habits of highly effective people & radical candor by Kim Scott ..
88	The first point, and I really want to emphasize this: I don’t hate Kirk Cousins and I don’t think he’s a bad QB. I think this is actually true for most people who get the label „Cousins Hater“..
89	@penpowersword I don't remember. I think I was in gyoshite because I distinctly remember other kids getting Zeus no chuusai and uragiri no Crete.
90	I think earl grey and cookies and cream is a lovely combo but if I was trying to be aesthetic I’d choose lavender.
91	i also think it’s hilarious when a girl hates you over a boy while she has a boyfriend like what you like him too 😭.
92	@andy_spoo @SarcasmStardust One think I think one can say about progressives with 100% certainty: If you are anti-communist, you can claim to be a progressive--but you cannot be. It is a contradiction..
93	I am glad the holiday is coming. It is a time to think analyze what worked, what didn't, and also a time to do nothing: rest, spend time with family, enjoy meals, but also reflect upon what we are looking to ourselves for the next year. 🤭😅 #rest #peace #babymelodyoficial .
94	@Thewarning9 I think this message is sent for "me". Indeed, i'm starting to wish death & hell to all those who serve sata$ and now tries to prevent us from having access to hospitals and to supermarkets to feed us & our families..
95	Head of the military, what a title. He didn’t think he’d get to see this title until Ryuunosuke is king. But now— Osamu always wanted to become head of the military. But he wanted to be head of the military under /Ryuunosuke’s/ rule, not in Ryuunosuke’s /stead/..
96	@BruceHannay Of course, it is to be expected as no one listens to a man who's broken many Covid rules himself. Think what you want about Scot Gov, I do believe they are setting a good example and I'm sure there are paparazzi just waiting to catch them in the company of more than 3 households!.
97	@QIU0FFICI4L // i see so you are bad at receiving affection, you probably bite people who try to hug you for the fun of it. you are hesitant to get close to people because you are fixated with presenting yourself as flawless, probably someone made you think of yourself as flawed in the past?.

102	two days ago told my dad i was getting my mom a cat and he said “no way you aren’t” and guess who’s looking at kittens with me now.
103	nothing is funnier 2 me than my parents switching so my mom can drive and my dad immediately putting on trap music.

105	@eslemefekeste1 its like this for long as i can remember tbh my dad is a psycho and fucking mental but i love him and i know my mom does too but sometimes even a little thing is not like how he wants it to be and he is immediatelly mad like a psycho... i have a anxiety bc if him like ???.
106	@oldmaxhall But Zach can’t throw and he leaves the pocket too soon and he never beat Utah and his mom is somewhat crazy and he wasn’t a captain and he had a cupcake schedule at BYU and only beat two P5 schools.

153	@SGaibrie Well that pretty much says the quiet part out loud that it really is only employers that matter. Sickness and death for the economy. And, as always, the privileged have other options and can limit their exposure. Doug Ford hasn't been to work for weeks. He has privilege..

155	"In this work, 'winners / losers' is the keyword, but honestly, I feel disgusted when it comes to labeling people as winners and losers. It is used in the world of sports... but when you think about life, what are the criteria for winning or losing?" .
156	@EastMidRailway Excellent news, glad the running data is accurate. that saves me having to give someone a lift after work..
157	@brumbitcoin that's weird. estonia has been positioning itself to embrace the digital revolution / internet / remote work / startups, etc. and then they do this which they will either reverse soon or come to regret.
158	@citizentvkenya Comments here never went to boarding school clearly. Ati parameters, sijui variables. Nkt. Counsellors & h/teachersexist therein . They know. Also kids nowadays flaunt their sexuality in public. You don't need an expert to point out Tomboys and femboys from a lineup #Hypocrites.
159	@mrfantasyfootay No. And yet, I'll keep pushing. I reckon we owe it to each other and to our kids to not give up..
160	baby how you doing i know youre not doing the best but im here i'll always be here .
161	@LizzieMarvelly I hear you. Felt that way with my January baby too. Sounds counter intuitive but the best thing I did wasn't walking, curries etc...but finding ways to relax e.g. a bath, listening to music, something that could set me up for a reasonable sleep. Thinking of you x.

169	this is a baby who thinks only of murder. be not fooled this was the FIRST time she ever was in my presence without trying to maul me with her little two pound body. her internal monologue is nothing but “attacka and killa you with my tongue” on loop. she is rage personified. .
170	it’s 2022!!!! y’all know what that means???? time to start shopping for baby girl. time is tickinggggg.
171	@HollyBDiaz Okay, I'm going to start doing this because actually drinking my coffee sounds amazing. 🤣.
172	Drink too much coffee and think of you often, In a city where reality has long been forgotten. Are you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified, but you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love..
173	Roy Mustang has a new song called 'hard locations'. It's about their experience with some sexual cuties..
174	We go back to school tomorrow and I officially open my very own special education classroom. I’ve worked so hard for this and I’m so happy. 🤍.
175	YES absolutely, there is a contingent of lazy good for nothing workers in the NHS that will scam the system at any chance they get, this is so unfair to the honest hard working employees who regularly put themselves out to pick up the slack caused by the scum. .
176	@YesItsM97576245 @vwheato I've always believed Autism is the next step in our evolution. I think these people use both sides of their brain and it's hard for some of them to unscramble all that knowledge..
177	I get too distracted when I try to read books on any device so it’s either hard cover or it’s not getting read 😭 .
178	@angelknivesflm as hard as it is, i think the best thing about being in your twenties is that you finally get to know and learn to love yourself 🤍.
179	@minor_mishap you’re on edge this year. past pain has made it hard for you to trust again and that’s okay, that’s something you’ll have to work on this year. give yourself grace this year in love, and don’t feel pressured to hop up and be ready for love immediately. .
180	Same thing happens on men's day. Instead of these children to celebrate and hype their day, they sit and sew threads faulting women for not once again doing what they, the men should be doing. Women work hard to hype women's day but they want us to also work to hype their day too.
181	As our general helped the oppressed Iraqi people in hard days, and never left them alone in the fight against ISIS, Abu Mahdi-al-Mohandas too, in hard days, stayed with his Iranian brothers, without expecting to get anything from them. #Hero .

184	Harris Gorp, the Eurovision Minister has just told me that they voted against the government tonight. Hard to see how Boris Johnson can carry on..
185	People don’t realize how hard it is to be a pet parent. You have to constantly protect them from the evils of this world- like the vacuum..
186	Are you sure you’re going to fulfil your new years resolutions? 🤷 If not, it's probably because you're being too hard on yourself. Most resolutions are extreme & impossible. In this thread I’ll share popular resolutions and super low-barrier first steps towards these goals!.

193	@NinaColasurdo1 I started knitting again in 2004, after letting decades go by since I'd knitted as a Girl Scout in the 1950s. I joined a weekly knitting group and hardly missed a meeting until my cat got sick in 2016. I didn't want to leave him at night, even for a couple of hours..
194	The same repetitive shite for hours: Fans at the darts might create a carnival atmosphere but get some new songs!!.
195	@3ventHorizon_ Man, I was thinking even 30 minutes tends to be on the long side (not that I mind if it goes that long), but TWO HOURS?! TWO. HOURS?! TWO FUCKING HOURS?!.

198	You know I tried this, I spent money on good parts from reputable companies and I regretted ever second of it. I’m actually selling a car I’ve but 100s of hours and 10s of thousands in to. At least when you eBay down pipe cracks or your rep’s bend you can’t be mad .
199	Went to Home Depot on a Sunday and found all the tatted guys in their late 20s mid 30s excuse me while I sit there for the next 3 hours..

201	As a #voiceactor, #radio #broadcaster and occasional singer, I found this film incredibly sad to watch and cried all the way through. This man is a genius, but lost the very soul that he was a few years back…his voice! If you have 2 hours spare…. .
202	FYI, almost exactly 2 hours from getting in line to leaving. We were not prepared to keep our kids occupied..
203	And that was my day! I had an extremely deep nap - fell asleep with the lights on, fully dressed, yt auto playing cooking videos. I woke up after a few hours and turned the lights off and went to bed proper, and had a less deep sleep. Do you find that happens to you?.
204	Still some hours left to join the discord and participate in this #CNFTGiveaway The winner of the duck race gets 1 pre-sale token that's one guaranteed @ADApesCNFT #CNFT airdropped to their wallet on mint day. .

207	This Fridays stream will be different than the normal. We'll be trying new shit, hopefully rinsing new acapellas, and playing a lot of different genres across all BPMs. 5 hours is a fuck ton of music. But we're gonna full send..
208	Taking hours to buy some tape at your local hardware/crafts store now sounds like a totally reasonable amount of time. .
209	Yes it can take 3+ hours to get your rapid Covid test because 100 people checked in before you and there’s only two testing machines on site with one person running the tests. So chill and play on your phone cause you would’ve been doing that at home anyway..
210	@BannedBtchBants I had it over xmas! Went on vacay to have a bit of time with no hospital and within 5 hours of arriving was in an ambulance. I got it very mild/asymptomatic but my heart couldn’t cope and went bananas on me. 6 days in hosp with iv Remdesivir & 10 days of dexamethasone. FUN.
211	Was going to do my 1st YouTube stream today.. didn’t realize there is a period of time that can take up to 24 hours to enable your account to go live 😌.
212	@ericthewheeler @LexG_III But why assume a movie titled "Licorice Pizza" with no famous actors in the main parts would make more than 7 million total if it opened wide quickly? I don't see it. West Side Story was even dead within 24 hours of release, they probably should have had THAT role out slower!.
213	The urge to get my lashes done before I give birth but mi can’t lay dung pan da table deh on my back for two hours 😩.

216	@NordVPN I just got off of a chat with Leroy with Nord VPN. He helped me get my new laptop connected after many hours of trying to watch Youtube videos (and the ads) trying on my own. Thank you Leroy!.
217	(You are at your local “Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria” after hours. You had hidden in the ball pit. You end up falling asleep in the ball pit for a few hours, but you are awoken by two big, furry hands grabbing your midsection. A giant 9ft tall yellow rabbit would reveal itself) .
218	@etihad 1st you delay our flight from Maldives to Abu Dhabi, missed our flight to KSA. Took almost 3 hours looking & waiting for the shuttle to Holiday Inn. Got to Holiday Inn, you gave us a voucher for 1 room. There’s 4 of us and the beds are 2 twin size. 😡.
219	The Biden administration has not done a good job executing our vaccination campaign. .
220	How about we stop ripping players, and start holding the coaches accountable who dip on their players for another job. Not one of y’all on College Gameday do that, just sit there and bash players for protecting their futures when coaches do the same shit. .
221	@SoCaliSteph He's had so many cries for help but nothing gets done and he keeps getting jobs. I think after this he won't be getting another job and you'll probably see him more on tmz.
222	We put the relationships with our employees and clients at the heart of everything we do each and every day. If also you value the art of building great work relationships, apply to our join team as a Security Officer in #SecurityGuard #SecurityOfficer.

230	It's crazy out there right now.. Stay at home if you can.. Don't trust the government..FukMo is Australia's worst PM ever. If you go to the hospital for an emergency they will not be able to help soon.. This is what I'm hearing recently.. Fuck! what time is beer o'clock again?.

234	Orwell wrote this book in 1949. So for 72 years we have kept this lower vibration fictional story in our consciousness & are currently living out the effects of it in daily life. Tell me who is living the life we were meant to live? Take a wild guess!.
235	Another day of character creation. I'm excited for this one So for Christmas I was gifted my own copy of Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica and the first race I wanted to look at was the Loxodon. Always thought they're cool but never wanted to explore it. Now that I have the book .
236	@AngusAngels So pleased,even though it was not in DG's book, that Murtagh was brought back loved the return so much! This scene always gives me a "Happy Cry"!🥲.

246	@LabelFreeBrands @thenewsuffrage It really would. My youngest kids' first word was "Duck" which is a rather cute name. I do actually know someone who named herself as a child. I don't know what her parents called her up until she was three, but she asked to be called "Area". She's surprisingly normal. 🤷🏻‍♀️.
247	Installing bark on my kids phones! And the reviews from these damn kids mad at they parents got me dead af!.

254	@unkonfined This is the key. No resentment, no grievance. The wind is blowing you in different directions. Walk away yourself sometimes. Especially when the soul of a relationship is gone. All thoughts, words and actions should come from a place of love. Everything else is born of EGO..
255	This time they forced it to gaseous form. The cleric turned it so they followed it, when the turn wore off it headed back to its resting place. Not knowing this, the mage fireballed it to ensure it was forced back to its coffin. 4/x.

259	@kiszkaesque the internet is a place where youre bound to see sexual content and you take that risk being on it, but we shouldnt be hiding our power house our factory. the thing we should be proud of as it develops. the body is a conundrum and should be praised, instead of treated like a +.
260	@CharlesMBlow No! They think they can run this honorary white man Republicans are trying to put in place to forward their agenda and stop progress on voting rights and other needed changes throughout the state. The same way they're trying to do all over the country..

262	@The_Shed_Talk I think his mother put any rumours about him leaving to bed the other day on Arabs anonymous (facebook). Rumour was he was Ipswich.

272	@CDavies000 @dgurdasani1 I think data science has changed things, the math tells our superiors what they can get away with, (which includes mass manslaughter apparently) bit of a leap from merely starving us, but the numbers say we'll suck it up, - still our fault of course.
273	For me Ali Smith accepting a CBE was just cringe and disappointing. That’s the only person I can think of where I’ve thought, ‘well, that’s a disappointing surprise’ .
274	@RStievenart Why? So far you've lied about Mexico paying for a wall, lied about funding being taken from the military and lied the 9th circuit Court issuing a opinion Instead of a ruling. You clearly live on a different planet. I think you should build the way legally. We disagree..

281	@OlwynHope @WarwickHunt4 @MarieAnnUK Somehow I don't think you're getting the meaning of the poster. In other words, they went above and beyond to save this little girl whilst those who were supposedly following the law, sought her out to do her harm. How can you not know the meaning of this?.
282	@Namiiikai yanfei tells the others everything about liyue and its laws. kokomi and raiden listen in fascination and eula looks at her proudly. weird group but i think they'd definitely get along..
283	How many of you wear a mask in the store where you don’t need to if you are fully vaxed, just so people don’t think you are stupid enough to take experimental mRNA gene therapeutic drugs?.

286	@Jane_tastic @absuRd_Nurse Similar numbers of overnight stays for vaccinated and unvaccinated but more vaccinated deaths. Maybe that's why you think unvaccinated are clogging wards as the jabbed are the ones dying..
287	AUGH! What was that!? Just watched “Matrix Resurrection” and the only thing I can think was that was a deliberate sabotage of the franchise by Lana Wachowski..
288	I think it's perfectly acceptable to send a man flowers and it's not as uncommon as some seem to think, but when I worked delivering flowers the equivalent non flower item was a fruit basket. .
289	@bdquinn I don't think either of these are really how his brain works. It would never occur to him to ask whether it's true or not. He will say anything and everything to get what we wants. That's it. That's the only thing he ever thinks about..
290	I know whoever sent this spam msg doesn't speak English and mistakenly used frivolous instead of loose/promiscuous, but all I can think of is a woman coming up to me in a club and whispering into my ear "do you want to go back to my place and file a bunch of unnecessary lawsuits" .
291	@eviljobob @Bob0Mar @jonocapps Also, no…again, you seem to think that I’m obsessed with what people think of me, being part of the club. I just do what I do. If that includes getting people I disagree with to waste time on me, then hooray!.

447	I don't like J. Peterson b/c of his stances on trans issues, but this is widely applicable : "You will be held to higher & higher & soon impossible to maintain ethical standards by the very mob you currently wish to please. Then you will make a mistake, & they will devour you".
448	You're going to realise very soon that most of the things you find acceptable to do on social media you would never do offline. Keep your standards up and consistent offline and online. It's really not that hard to be a decent person and kind person..

594	@GustavHerwitz We need a bout. Clifford should go with Bortuzzo. You know, ask how the wife and kids are doing..
595	“I realized that we have a school system right now that is so narrow that it makes a lot of kids (especially boys, I think) feel that they aren’t good at anything. Their experience of school is contantly being made to feel incompetent.” Yeah, or shut outside classes, bullied..
596	@MrsScissons @SaskTeachersFed Read my previous tweets about teachers I’ve often said there are many teachers being drowned out by the other ones who look for any excuse to get shutdown and back home!!! Clearly you’re in the minority who are in it for the kids.
597	@roguefembot Ah cool. My parents are Central American but I grew up mostly around Mexican kids. It's kind of funny actually, I feel like I know more about Mexican culture than my own. Tbh most people assume I'm Mex Am lol.
598	@mtboyinjapan @usagi_matto Depends where you live - we're in central Tokyo and have had a car for about 6-7 years, but we only drive it once a month. When the pandemic started that went up to 2-3 times a month. We only have a car (2 kids) because my wife wants one, we don't need one though..
